# Light-to-Dark Theme Switcher in React
# Description
This React project demonstrates how to implement a light-to-dark theme switcher by changing the background color using React's state management.

# Features
Toggle between light and dark themes.
Utilizes React state to manage the theme switch.
Changes the background color dynamically based on the selected theme.

# Usage
Click on the theme switch button to toggle between light and dark themes.
Observe the background color change according to the selected theme.

# Implementation Details
The project uses React to manage the state of the theme. It maintains a theme state variable that determines the current theme (either "light" or "dark"). When the theme switch button is clicked, it toggles the theme state between light and dark, which triggers a re-render and updates the background color accordingly.
